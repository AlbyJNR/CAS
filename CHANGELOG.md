# Changelog

Write every entry in ASD-STE100 Simplified Technical English:

- Write one idea in each sentence. Use 20 words or fewer in each sentence.
- Use the active voice and the present tense.
- Write instructions as commands: "Select **Subtitles**", not "**Subtitles** can be selected".
- Use one word for one thing. Use the names that Alder shows on the screen.
- Put the 3 most interesting changes first.

Put changes that are not released under `## Unreleased`. Rename that heading to the version number when you release.

## Unreleased

- **Title details with any add-ons.** Alder now asks your add-ons for details in their order, as Stremio does. When one add-on fails, Alder asks the next one. Before, some setups showed "Couldn't load this title's details" on every title.
- Titles show when an add-on sends an episode without an id.

## 1.1

- Each profile keeps its own streaming add-ons. Add-ons that you add or remove in Stremio show in Alder on the next page.
- Continue Watching shows correctly when Home opens for the first time.
- The **Audio & subtitles** panel in the player opens correctly.
- In **Search**, the selected poster is no longer cut off at the top.

## 1.0

- **Press Play and it plays.** Alder picks a good source and starts it. Hold OK on **Play** to see every source.
- **Automatic fallback.** When a stream fails, Alder tries the next one from the same second.
- **Only what your TV can play.** Alder checks your TV for 4K, HDR, Dolby Vision, HEVC, AV1 and DTS. It hides files that the TV cannot play.
- **Profiles.** Up to 5 profiles, each with its own Stremio account. A PIN is optional.
- **Stream preferences in plain words:** **Best picture**, **Balanced** or **Fast start**.
- **Series.** The next episode keeps the same release and quality. **Skip intro** is built in.
- **Continue Watching on the Google TV home screen.**
- **Frame-rate matching.** The TV changes to the film's frame rate.
- **Sync with Stremio.** Watch progress matches your phone and computer.
- **Updates.** Alder finds new versions on GitHub and installs them.
