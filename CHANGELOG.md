# CAS changelog

Write every entry in ASD-STE100 Simplified Technical English (STE):

- Use only the approved words of the STE dictionary, with their approved meanings. You can also use technical names: CAS, Stremio, add-on, subtitle, and the names that CAS shows on the screen.
- Write one idea in each sentence. Write 20 words or fewer in an instruction and 25 words or fewer in a description.
- Use the active voice. Use the simple present tense, or the simple past tense for "Before, …".
- Do not use words that end in "-ing", except in technical names.
- Do not use contractions. Write "does not", not "doesn't". Text that CAS shows on the screen stays as it is.
- Write instructions as commands: "Select **Subtitles**", not "**Subtitles** can be selected".
- Use one word for one thing. Use the names that CAS shows on the screen.
- Put the 3 most interesting changes first.

Put changes that are not released under `## Unreleased`. Before each release, read all of `## Unreleased` again and rewrite each entry that does not obey these rules. Then rename that heading to the version number.

## Unreleased

## 1.7.2

- **Clearer focus.** A button or chip under the remote turns white with dark words. Rows under the remote are brighter.
- **A bigger box.** Trailers and previews play in a box two thirds of the screen wide.
- **Trailer, Preview and Recap on their own line** under Play, so a title with many controls shows all of them. Before, the Trailer button could be missing on a series.

## 1.7.1

- **Last crash.** When CAS closes on its own, the next start says so, and **Settings → About → Last crash** shows what went wrong.
- **Subtitles that arrive late** no longer start a paused title or pause a playing one.
- Every build now starts on a TV emulator before it is published.

## 1.7.0

- **Trailers in the box, on every TV.** Select **Trailer** and the trailer plays in the box over the page, with a picture, on Fire TV too. CAS now plays the trailer file itself, from IMDb or from your add-on, instead of a YouTube page. A title with only a YouTube trailer still opens the way **Settings → Title page → Trailers play** says.

## 1.6.0

- **Preview any episode.** In the episode list, press Right on an episode to preview it in the box. Hold OK for its sources, as before.
- **Screensaver.** After five minutes without a key on Home, one of your Continue Watching titles fills the screen with its art and a clock. Any key returns. **Settings → Picture & sound → Screensaver** turns it off.

## 1.5.0

- **Preview.** Select **Preview** on a title. A minute of the film or episode plays in a box over the page, a little way in, through the same sources as Play. OK pauses, Left and Right skip 10 seconds, Back closes. The box closes by itself when the minute is up. A preview does not change your progress.
- **TV, not Shows.** The top bar, the Library filter and Search say **TV**.
- **Settings → Title page → Preview button** turns the preview on or off.

## 1.4.2

- **Trailers open in Silk on Fire TV.** The browser is now the first choice there. The box plays sound only on Fire TV, whatever is tried, so it stays as an option for other TVs.

## 1.4.1

- **Trailers in the browser.** **Settings → Title page → Trailers play** has a third choice: the TV's browser, full screen (Silk on Fire TV).
- **The box, one more try on Fire TV.** With **In a box over the page** selected, the window goes see-through where the box is, so a picture Fire OS draws behind the app can show inside it.

## 1.4.0

- **A new mark.** The CAS aperture: a C with a dot, on the launcher tile, the icon and beside the name on every screen.
- **Trailers play in the YouTube app on Fire TV.** Full screen, with a picture. **Settings → Title page → Trailers play** chooses the app or CAS's own box. A box that shows no picture switches the TV to the app by itself.

## 1.3.3

- **Trailers, again.** The box now shows YouTube's own player page, which draws its picture where the earlier page did not. A small grey line under the box reports what the TV's browser engine does with the video, for this test build.

## 1.3.2

- **Series pages stay visible.** Before, a series page could go blank when its details arrived while the episode list was open.
- **The remote stays put.** On a title page, focus no longer jumps back to Play when more details arrive.
- **Recap and trailer hand-offs work on newer TVs.** Before, Fire OS 8 and Android TV 11 said there was no YouTube app.
- **Search → My List** opens the Library page. Before, it opened Home.
- **Smaller downloads.** Episode stills and title logos load at the size they show, not twice it.
- **Smoother first screen.** Cache housekeeping no longer runs on the main thread at launch.
- Settings checks for updates once per visit, not on every focus change.
- Updates on Android 12+ install without a confirm box after the first one.

## 1.3.1

- **Trailers show their picture.** Before, a trailer played its sound over a black box on some TVs.

## 1.3.0

- **Focus with weight.** Posters, buttons and rows settle into focus with a small spring. Press OK and the control dips, then springs back.
- **Softer changes.** A new title's name and facts fade in with its art. A new page's rows fade in.
- **Settings icons.** Title page, Profile, Language and Storage have icons that match the other sections.
- **Library filters.** A hairline parts the filter chips from the sort chips.

## 1.2.0

- **Trailers.** Select **Trailer** on a title. The trailer plays in a box over the title. Press OK to pause, Left or Right to skip 10 seconds, and Back to close.
- **Cast on the title page.** The three leads show under the description. Select a name to find their other films and shows. Select the information button to see the full cast.
- **Director on the title page.** Films show the director under the cast.
- **Recap.** On a series, select **Recap** to search for the season's recap in the TV's YouTube app.
- **Title page settings.** **Settings → Title page** turns the trailer button, the recap button, the cast, the director and the art behind the trailer on or off.

- **All subtitle languages in the player.** **Audio & subtitles** shows all the languages from your subtitle add-ons. Your subtitle language and English are at the top. Before, CAS showed only the language of the TV and English.
- **All audio languages.** **Settings → Picture & Sound → Audio language** has all the languages. Before, it had only 7. Frequently used languages are at the top.
- **CAS keeps your choices from the player.** Select an audio language or subtitles in **Audio & subtitles**. The next episode starts with your choice. When you start the title again, it also starts with your choice. Each profile keeps its own choices.
- When CAS changes to a different source, your subtitle choice stays.
- **See your subtitles quickly.** When the player controls show, a line under the progress bar shows the audio language and the subtitles. For example: "English · Spanish subtitles".
- In **Audio & subtitles**, each heading shows the choice in use. For example: "Subtitles · Spanish". A dot shows the choice in use in each list.
- CAS matches language names from all sources, for example "es", "spa" and "Spanish". Before, some subtitles and audio tracks did not match.
- **Portuguese (Brazil)** and **Portuguese** are 2 different languages.
- An add-on subtitle in your language does not start the video again.
- Lists in **Settings** are not transparent.
- **Skip forward in more movies.** CAS finds the correct position in files that have no index, for example .ts files. Before, a skip forward on the progress bar started these movies again from the beginning.
- Some sources cannot skip. In these sources, CAS shows a message, and the movie continues. To get a different source, select **Change stream**.
- **Title details with all add-ons.** CAS gets title details from your add-ons in their order, as Stremio does. When an add-on gives no details, CAS uses the next add-on. Before, some users saw "Couldn't load this title's details" on all titles.
- CAS shows a title when an add-on sends an episode that has no id.
- **Sources in your audio language.** Select a language above the source list. CAS shows only the sources in that language. Sources with "Multi" or "Dual" audio show for all languages.

- **Profiles stay after a sign-out.** When Stremio signs a profile out of this TV, CAS keeps the profile. Select the profile and sign in again. The settings and the PIN of the profile stay. Before, CAS removed the profile.
- When you remove a profile, CAS does not sign out a Stremio account that another profile uses.
- CAS tells you when you add a Stremio account that another profile already uses.
- The sign-in page tells you how to connect 2 accounts with 1 phone.
- **Add-ons with an http:// address work.** CAS connects to add-ons and sources with an http:// address, for example add-ons on your home network. Before, all of these failed.
- **CAS tells you why there is no source.** For example, an add-on did not answer, or an add-on found only torrents.
- CAS sends its name and version to add-ons. Before, some add-ons blocked CAS.
- Sources with only Dolby Vision show on all TVs. When your TV cannot show them correctly, they are at the end of the list.
- **What is new after each update.** After CAS updates, Home shows the changes in the new version. Select **See all changes** to read all of them. Select **Settings → About → What's new** to read them again.
- **Updates on Fire TV.** CAS does not stop when it asks for permission to install an update. When the TV has no page for this permission, CAS shows the steps.
- After you let CAS install apps, the update continues. Before, you had to select **Install** again.
- When the download of an update stops or is not complete, CAS tells you. Before, nothing happened.
- Before an update, CAS tells you that it closes. Open CAS again after the update.
- **Remove titles from Continue Watching.** Hold OK on a title in **Continue**. Then select **Remove from Continue Watching**. Stremio also removes it on your other devices. When you watch the title again, it comes back.

- Hold OK on a title in **Continue** now opens a menu. To see all sources, select **Choose a source**.
- **See the debrid service of each source.** The source list shows the service of each source, for example **RD** for Real-Debrid. **⚡** shows that the file is ready and starts immediately.
- The player shows the debrid service of the source that plays, for example "Torrentio · 2160p · Real-Debrid".
- **All catalogs from AIOMetadata show.** Before, CAS did not show a catalog that needs a genre, for example an AIOMetadata catalog that is not on the Stremio home page. Now CAS shows these catalogs, as Stremio does. This also corrects a **Shows** page with no rows.
