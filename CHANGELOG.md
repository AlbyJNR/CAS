# Changelog

Write every entry in ASD-STE100 Simplified Technical English (STE):

- Use only the approved words of the STE dictionary, with their approved meanings. You can also use technical names: Alder, Stremio, add-on, subtitle, and the names that Alder shows on the screen.
- Write one idea in each sentence. Write 20 words or fewer in an instruction and 25 words or fewer in a description.
- Use the active voice. Use the simple present tense, or the simple past tense for "Before, …".
- Do not use words that end in "-ing", except in technical names.
- Do not use contractions. Write "does not", not "doesn't". Text that Alder shows on the screen stays as it is.
- Write instructions as commands: "Select **Subtitles**", not "**Subtitles** can be selected".
- Use one word for one thing. Use the names that Alder shows on the screen.
- Put the 3 most interesting changes first.

Put changes that are not released under `## Unreleased`. Before each release, read all of `## Unreleased` again and rewrite each entry that does not obey these rules. Then rename that heading to the version number.

## Unreleased

- **Add-ons with an http:// address work.** Alder connects to add-ons and sources with an http:// address, for example add-ons on your home network. Before, all of these failed.
- **Alder tells you why there is no source.** For example, an add-on did not answer, or an add-on found only torrents.
- Alder sends its name and version to add-ons. Before, some add-ons blocked Alder.
- Sources with only Dolby Vision show on all TVs. When your TV cannot show them correctly, they are at the end of the list.

## 1.1

- Each profile keeps its own streaming add-ons. Add-ons that you add or remove in Stremio show in Alder on the next page.
- Continue Watching shows correctly when Home opens for the first time.
- The **Audio & subtitles** panel in the player opens correctly.
- In **Search**, the selected poster is no longer cut off at the top.

## 1.0

- **Press Play and it plays.** Alder picks a good source and starts it. Hold OK on **Play** to see every source.
- **Automatic fallback.** When a stream fails, Alder tries the next one from the same second.
- **Only what your TV can play.** Alder checks your TV for 4K, HDR, Dolby Vision, HEVC, AV1 and DTS. It hides files that the TV cannot play.
- **Profiles.** Up to 5 profiles, each with its own Stremio account. A PIN is optional.
- **Stream preferences in plain words:** **Best picture**, **Balanced** or **Fast start**.
- **Series.** The next episode keeps the same release and quality. **Skip intro** is built in.
- **Continue Watching on the Google TV home screen.**
- **Frame-rate matching.** The TV changes to the film's frame rate.
- **Sync with Stremio.** Watch progress matches your phone and computer.
- **Updates.** Alder finds new versions on GitHub and installs them.
